Spam Email Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithm



Description:-

This is a Machine Learning Project that uses various Machine Learning Algorithm to classify an email to be an Spam Email or Non-Spam (Ham) Email. I have used many classification algorithm( Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms) like Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with Cross Validation, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier.
