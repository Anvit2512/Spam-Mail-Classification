Spam Email Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithm



Description:-

This is a Machine Learning Project that uses various Machine Learning Algorithm to classify an email to be an Spam Email or Non-Spam (Ham) Email. I have used many classification algorithm( Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms) like Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with Cross Validation, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier.


# 📧 Spam Mail Classification

This repository contains a **Spam Mail Classification** project implemented using **Streamlit** for interactive UI and **Machine Learning** models for classifying emails as spam or not spam.

## 🔍 Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails into spam or non-spam categories based on their content.
